Implementation of lexical analysis, parsers and evaluating machines to interpret basic language.


Key Features:
- Environment handling (variable bindings, lookup functions)
- Expression evaluation (arithmetic, boolean, comparisons)
- Error management (type errors, unbound variables, divide by zero)
- Regular expression-based tokenization
- Handling various token types (parentheses, operators, comparisons, etc.)
- AST construction
- Syntax validation
- Error handling for unexpected tokens

Integration of all forms a basic interpreter for MicroCAML, understanding the basics of language interpretation.
